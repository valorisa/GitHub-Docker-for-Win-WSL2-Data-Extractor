# Installation Guide for the Project

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the Python environment and install the required libraries for this project.

---

## **1. Verify Python Installation**

Before proceeding, ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can check this by running:



If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions. Make sure to select the option to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

---

## **2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

Using a virtual environment helps isolate the project's dependencies. To create and activate a virtual environment:

### On Linux/Mac:


### On Windows:


Once activated, you will see ` (venv) ` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

---

## **3. Install Required Libraries**

The project uses the following Python libraries:

- `requests`: For interacting with the GitHub API.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `transformers`: For generating automatic summaries using advanced language models.

To install these libraries, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a `requirements.txt` File
Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the root directory of your project and add the following content:



### Step 2: Install the Libraries
Run the following command to install all the required libraries:



This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all the specified libraries and their dependencies.

---

## **4. Verify Installation**

After installation, you can verify that the libraries were installed correctly by listing all installed packages:



You should see the installed libraries (`requests`, `pandas`, `transformers`) in the output.

---

## **5. Run the Scripts**

Once the libraries are installed, you can execute the Python scripts located in the `scripts/` directory. For example:



These scripts will process the data and generate outputs in the `output/` directory.

---

## **6. Deactivate the Virtual Environment**

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:



---

## **7. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: Missing Module Error**
If you encounter an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xxx'`, ensure that all libraries are installed by running:



### **Issue 2: Permission Errors**
If you face permission issues during installation, try adding the `--user` flag:



### **Issue 3: Incompatible Python Version**
Ensure you are using Python 3.7 or higher. Some libraries, such as `transformers`, require a recent version of Python.

---

## **8. Explanation of Libraries**

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the libraries used in this project:

1. **`requests`**:
   - Used to send HTTP requests to the GitHub API for extracting issue data.

2. **`pandas`**:
   - Used for handling structured data, such as converting JSON data into CSV format.

3. **`transformers`**:
   - Provides pre-trained language models for tasks like summarization, enabling automatic generation of summaries from issue descriptions.
